# Term patterns for Korean parsing.
#
# Columns:
#   pattern     - the pattern to match against. If 'translation' is non-empty,
#                 then this the pattern must match the *whole* word to be
#                 applicable.
#   translation - the translation to use for words that match this pattern.
#   tags        - tags to add to the generated word if this rule is applied.
#                 Multiple tags may be specified as a comma-separated list. Note
#                 that the field must be quoted in this case.
#   parents     - parent words to add to the generated word if this rule is
#                 applied. Multiple parents may be specified as a
#                 comma-separated list. Note that the field must be quoted in
#                 this case.
#   output      - the pattern to replace the matched pattern with.
#
# For each row, exactly one of 'translation' or 'output' must be specified. For
# 'translation' rules, the pattern must match the whole word for the rule to be
# applied. For 'output' rules, a partial match is sufficient. A 'translation'
# rule will always be preferred over an 'output' rule. If both 'translation' and
# 'output' are unspecified, the rule is treated as an 'output' rule that removes
# the matched elements.
#
# Patterns are plus-separated sequences of terms, with each term having the form
# <text>/<part_of_speech>/<subtype>. Although Mecab supports "subtypes" -- e.g.,
# proper nouns (NNP) may be further classified as names, places, etc. -- LIT
# ignores these, so <subtype> is always '*'. A '*' used for the <text> field on
# the first element of a pattern matches the root word.
#
# Several example rules are provided below, but you may wish to start with an
# empty patterns file and add your own rules as you discover them.

# Canonicalize different ways of expressing the same thing (in this case, the
# past tense form), so that separate translation rules are not needed every time
# one of these shows up in a larger pattern.
