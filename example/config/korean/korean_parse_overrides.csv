# Korean parse overrides file.
#
# Columns:
#   word    - the word to apply the override to.
#   parsing - the parsing output for the word.
#
# The parsing is a semicolon-separated list of patterns applied to substrings of
# the original word. The form is:
#
#   <substring>(<pattern>);<substring>(<pattern>);...
#
# Each pattern is as described in the 'korean_term_patterns.csv' example file.
# The substrings must match the original word when concatenated.
#
# A few examples are provided below.
